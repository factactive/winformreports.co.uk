<p><b>Feature Overview</b></p>
<p>All adapters integrate with the Visual Studio .NET design environment and the .NET printing architecture. This means that you can design the style of your printed output in the VS.NET designer, without any coding, and then print or print preview using the standard .NET PrintPreviewDialog classes.</p>
<p>PrintListView and PrintDataTable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom print styles can be designed in VS.NET or modified programmatically at runtime. Alternatively PrintListView can automatically create a set of style settings which accurately mirror the current settings of the ListView.</li>
<li>Pre-defined styles can be applied to the printed output via the VS.NET designer.</li>
<li>The controls are derived from PrintDocument, so you can use it in place of PrintDocument in the .NET framework to simply print out a ListView across multiple pages.</li>
<li>Custom printouts are supported. The <b>Draw</b> method allows you to specify the available rectangular space - and the control will render as many of the rows of data as it can into that space. Calling Draw again for subsequent pages will continue rendering until all rows have been printed.</li>
</ul>
<p>PrintTreeView:</p>
<ul>
<li>The starting node(s) to be printed can be set by the user or automatically detected (<b>PrintTreeView.AutoDetectRootNodes</b> property). Starting/root nodes can be manually specifed via the <b>PrintTreeView.RootNodes</b>property.</li>
<li>The Tree can be printed fully expanded or in its current state of expansion at the time of printout by setting the <b>PrintTreeView.PrintTreeExpanded</b>property.</li>
<li>PrintTreeView is derived from PrintDocument, so you can use it in place of PrintDocument in the .NET framework to simply print out a tree across multiple pages.</li>
<li>Custom printouts are supported. PrintTreeView's <b>PrintTree</b> method allows you to specify the available rectangular space - and PrintTreeView will render as many of the TreeView's nodes as it can into that space. Calling PrintTree again for subsequent pages will continue rendering the tree until all nodes have been printed.</li>
</ul>
<p>PrintRichTextBox:</p>
<ul>
<li>PrintRichTextBox is derived from PrintDocument, so you can use it in place of PrintDocument in the .NET framework to simply print out a RichTextBox across multiple pages.</li>
<li>Custom printouts are supported. PrintRichTextBox's <b>Draw</b> method allows you to specify the available rectangular space - and PrintRichTextBox will render as much of the RichTextBox's contents as it can into that space. Calling Draw again for subsequent pages will continue rendering the RichTextBox until all the contents have been printed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>You must be logged in as an <b>Administrator</b> when you install PrintAdapters.NET. To begin the installation process, run the setup.exe program included with your installation files. After the installation process has completed you will need to add the PrintAdapters components to your Toolbox in Visual Studio.NET using the following procedure:</p><p>1. Open the Visual Studio .NET editor.<br/>
2. Right click on the 'General' tab of the Toolbox, and select 'Customise Toolbox...'. (You may alternatively add it to the Windows Forms tab, or create a new tab).<br/>
3. Select the '.NET Framework Components' tab of the Customise Toolbox Dialog and scroll down until you find 'Barcode' with a namespace of TMGDevelopment.Windows.Forms. Check this, highlight the row and click the namespace column header to sort by namespace. Check all the other controls in the TMGDevelopment.Windows.Forms namespace and click OK.</p>
<p>You should now be able to drag any PrintAdapters component from the General Tab of the Toolbox onto your Form.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>PrintAdapters includes a number of sample applications, but probably  
the best place to get started is with the Getting Started document in the help file, and 
the accompanying GettingStarted project installed under the PrintAdapters entry on your 
Start menu.</p>
